2022.12.10 brainstorming:

- a CLI application that takes in the kubeconfig, and has a nice interactive CLI menu where you can choose if you want to do a mutating webhook or a validating webhook. Then, you can select which type of object you want to create the admission controller rule for (POD,DaemonSet,Deployment, etc.). Then, you select what you want (e.g resource limit, label, selector, tag, etc.), type it in, press enter, and bumm magic happens.
